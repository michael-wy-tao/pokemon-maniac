#7dayCodingChallenge

DEMO:
https://pokemon-maniac.herokuapp.com/

Pokemon Maniac is an app that lets you browse the Pokedex and find your favorite pokemon, and play pokemon battle simulation at the same time.

All data used in this app is acquired from https://pokeapi.co/


Future Improvement:
1. Style better (very rough css styling right now)
2. Implement some loading icons, infinite scrolling
3. Implement type weaknessess and damage bonus
4. Implement actual damage calculation formula (right now all skills are dealing random damage)
5. Distinguish the attack moves and the self-buff moves (right now all moves are treated as attack moves)
6. Fix the bug that randomize the four skills when clicking "fight"
7. Add in game commentary, sound effects and battle log
8. Implement "Bag", "Pokemon" and "Run" functions
9. Instead of randomly pick ally pokemon and enemy pokemon, have the user walk on a grass field to encounter next enemy pokemon
10. Maybe implement a catching pokemon feature
11. Make sure app is compatible on android/ios, and all kinds of browsers (so far only tested on Chrome and IE)
