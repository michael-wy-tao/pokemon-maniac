#7dayCodingChallenge

DEMO:
https://pokemon-maniac.herokuapp.com/

Pokemon Maniac is an app that lets you browse the Pokedex and find your favorite pokemon, and play pokemon battle simulation at the same time.

All data used in this app is acquired from https://pokeapi.co/


Future Improvement:
1. Fix the bug that the user can spam attack skill and skip enemy's turn
2. Style better (very rough css styling right now)
3. Implement some loading icons, infinite scrolling
4. Implement type weaknessess and damage bonus
5. Implement actual damage calculation formula (right now all skills are dealing random damage)
6. Distinguish the attack moves and the self-buff moves (right now all moves are treated as attack moves)
7. Fix the bug that randomize the four skills when clicking "fight"
8. Fix the bug that when user loses, the game doesn't reset immediately (right now you have to click on another attack move to reset)
9. Add in game commentary, sound effects and battle log
10. Implement "Bag", "Pokemon" and "Run" functions
11. Instead of randomly pick ally pokemon and enemy pokemon, have the user walk on a grass field to encounter next enemy pokemon
12. Maybe implement a catching pokemon feature
13. Make sure app is compatible on android/ios, and all kinds of browsers (so far only tested on Chrome and IE)
14. Make search function available in the Pokedex
